# Galaxy-Classification
The codes written here are template codes for the purpose of creating a BPT diagram. 
The Bpt diagram is a Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram that classifies galaxies with narrow emission lines according to their line intensity ratios.
Data from the SDSS DR18 catalog were used in this classification.
